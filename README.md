# creatingS3bucket-1
In this task, I created a cloud storage bucket using Amazon S3 to understand the basics of object storage. I set up a unique S3 bucket, and uploaded a sample file (text) to the bucket. The file was successfully stored in the cloud and made accessible via an Object URL, demonstrating how files can be stored, retrieved, and shared through cloud-based object storage. This exercise provided hands-on experience with bucket creation, object uploading, and access management in AWS S3.
